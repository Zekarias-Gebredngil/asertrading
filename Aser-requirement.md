For a product using a consistent base unit:
New weighted-average cost
(Existing stock quantity × Existing average cost + Received quantity × Received unit cost) / Total stock quantity after receipt
Example:
•	Existing stock: 100 meters at ETB 50 per meter.
•	New receipt: 50 meters at ETB 60 per meter.
•	Total stock: 150 meters.
•	Total inventory cost: ETB 8,000.
•	New average cost: ETB 53.3333 per meter, approximately.
The system must retain sufficient decimal precision internally and apply the approved rounding policy to displayed monetary amounts.
7.2 Costing rules
•	Purchase costs must be normalized to the product's base unit.
•	Eligible landed costs may be included according to the approved accounting policy.
•	Issues use the applicable weighted-average cost at posting time.
•	Returns and reversals must reference the original transaction where possible.
•	Cost changes must be auditable.
•	Historical transactions must retain their original posted values.
•	Stock valuation reports must use consistent cost snapshots and transaction cutoffs.

•	Versioned REST API.
•	Identity and access module.
•	Product catalog module.
•	Inventory ledger module.
•	Branch and warehouse module.

10.3 Architecture principles
•	PostgreSQL is the source of truth for stock, orders, payments and transaction history.
•	Inventory changes must be performed through authorized application services.
•	Related stock, order and reservation changes must use database transactions.
•	External payment processing must not hold a database transaction open while waiting for a provider.
•	Payment callbacks must be verified and idempotent.
•	Domain modules must communicate through explicit interfaces.
•	File uploads must use controlled storage rather than public server directories.
•	Database changes must be version-controlled and tested.

11.2 Important fields and constraints
Products must have unique SKUs. Warehouses must belong to branches. Stock balances must be unique for the applicable product, warehouse and tracking dimension.
Stock movements must include:
•	Product and location.
•	Quantity delta in base units.
•	Movement type.
•	Reference type and reference ID.
•	Actor.
•	Posting timestamp.
•	Cost information where applicable.
•	Correlation or idempotency reference where appropriate.
Orders must contain immutable-at-confirmation line-item snapshots of product description, SKU, unit price, quantity, discounts and applicable tax calculations.
Payments must reference orders and retain provider transaction identifiers where applicable.
Foreign keys, check constraints, unique constraints and appropriate indexes must enforce data integrity.
Monetary amounts must use exact decimal types. Inventory quantities must use an appropriate fixed-precision decimal type when fractional quantities are permitted.
11.3 Inventory invariants
For each product and stock location:
On-hand quantity = opening quantity + sum of posted stock movement deltas
Reserved quantity must be maintained separately from physical on-hand quantity.
Available to sell = eligible on-hand quantity − active reservations
Eligibility must account for stock that is damaged, quarantined, in transit or otherwise unavailable for sale.
The inventory ledger must be append-only through ordinary application workflows. Corrections must use traceable compensating movements.
11.4 Order and payment integrity
•	A single order must not be confirmed twice.
•	Payment confirmation must not create duplicate order fulfillment.
•	Duplicate payment callbacks must be safely ignored or reconciled.
•	Stock reservation and order-state changes must be atomic where they share a database boundary.
•	Payment-provider calls must use unique idempotency references where supported.
•	Failed payment attempts must not be interpreted as successful payments.
•	Refunds must be linked to authorized return or cancellation decisions.

23.	Repeating a dispatch request does not deduct stock twice.
24.	Simultaneous stock issues cannot consume more than the available balance.
25.	A user without approval permission cannot approve a transfer.
26.	A branch user cannot access another branch's restricted records.
27.	Approved adjustments produce traceable ledger entries.
28.	Historical stock transactions cannot be silently edited.
17.4 Weighted-average costing
29.	Receiving inventory at a new cost recalculates the weighted-average cost correctly.
30.	Issues use the applicable average cost at posting time.
31.	Cost calculations use base units and defined precision.
32.	Returns and reversals preserve traceability.
33.	Inventory valuation reports reconcile to the defined costing policy.
17.5 Spreadsheet migration and operations
34.	Invalid spreadsheets are rejected with row-level error details.
35.	Dry-run imports do not modify inventory.
36.	An approved import creates opening balances exactly once.
37.	Duplicate import commits are prevented.
38.	Backup restoration recovers inventory, orders and transaction history.
39.	Revoked users cannot continue accessing protected operations.
40.	Production health checks and post-deployment smoke tests pass.
Release requires successful completion of critical business, security and data-integrity tests, followed by business acceptance.
18. Cloud Deployment and DevOps
18.1 Deployment architecture
The cloud deployment shall include:
•	Public frontend.
•	Protected application API.
•	Managed PostgreSQL where feasible.
•	Private file storage.
•	HTTPS ingress or reverse proxy.
•	Secure secrets management.
•	Centralized logging and monitoring.
•	Separate backup storage.
Production and staging environments must be separated.
18.2 CI/CD pipeline
GitHub CI shall run:
1.	Code quality and formatting checks.
2.	Unit and integration tests.
3.	Database migration tests.
4.	Dependency and secret scanning.
5.	Container image builds and security scans.
6.	Staging deployment.
7.	End-to-end acceptance tests.
8.	Approved production deployment.
9.	Health checks and smoke tests.
Production migrations must be reviewed, tested, and designed for safe rollout. Backups and rollback procedures must be documented.

A detailed schedule and budget shall be established after reviewing the existing inventory spreadsheets, payment-provider requirements, hosting choice, and the number of branches and users.
20. Deliverables
The implementation contract shall require:
•	Complete source code and repository access.
•	Responsive public website and administration dashboard.
•	E-commerce and inventory modules.
•	Database schema and migration scripts.
•	API documentation.
•	Spreadsheet import templates and validation reports.
•	Automated test suites and results.
•	GitHub CI/CD pipeline and deployment configuration.
•	Production setup and security checklist.
•	Backup and recovery documentation.
•	User and administrator manuals.
•	Training and handover.
•	Defined warranty and support terms.
21. Outstanding Decisions
The main business decisions have been confirmed. The following implementation details still require approval:
1.	Payment provider: Confirm Telebirr or another provider, supported payment methods, refund capabilities, and provider fees. => Payments should perform with Manual transfer and in hand Cash
2.	Delivery policy: Confirm delivery coverage, charges, branch collection rules and whether third-party delivery integration is required. => Decides with phone call agreements
3.	Taxes and invoices: Confirm applicable tax calculations, invoice formats, and business accounting requirements with the responsible accountant. 
4.	Order fulfillment: Confirm whether an order may be fulfilled from multiple branches or must be fulfilled from one selected location. => Orders should be fulfilled from the available branches of the company
5.	Reservation timing: Confirm when stock is reserved and how long unpaid orders remain pending. => If they pay an advance payment as soon as the order is placed, the reservation must be revoked.
6.	Transfer approvals: Define approval thresholds and permitted approver roles.=> Branch managers request the transfer, and the system admin or owner approves the transfer.
7.	Costing policy: Confirm the treatment of freight, discounts, returns and other landed costs. => Discounts and other policies should be configurable by the System admin and displayed on the stock as badge by following the brand of the company.
8.	Spreadsheet migration: Approve the data template, initial stock cutoff date and reconciliation procedure. To be decided later,
9.	Hosting and recovery: Approve the hosting budget, recovery targets and operational support arrangements.
10.	Product pricing: Confirm which products have fixed prices and which require quotation-based pricing. => this Should be configurable
These decisions must be resolved before the affected functionality is finalized for production.
22. Final Conclusion
Aser Trading should implement one integrated platform with a public marketing website, online sales capabilities, and a secure, multi-branch inventory management system.
The core design should prioritize inventory accuracy, weighted-average costing, stock reservation, controlled transfers, secure payment processing, and auditable business transactions.
The recommended Angular/TypeScript, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL modular-monolith architecture provides a maintainable foundation for the first release while allowing future expansion into accounting, manufacturing, advanced analytics, and external integrations.
